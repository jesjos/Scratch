### Recursive type

You already encountered recursive types.
Typically, you can re-create lists, but with a more verbose syntax:

~~~
data List a = Empty | Cons a (List a)
~~~

If you really want to use an easier syntax you can use infix name for constructors.

~~~
infixr 5 :::
data List a = Nil | a ::: (List a)
~~~

The number after `infixr` is the priority.

If you want to be able to print (`Show`), read (`Read`), test equality (`Eq`) and compare (`Ord`) your new data structure you can tell Haskell to derive the appropriate function for you.

> infixr 5 :::
> data List a = Nil | a ::: (List a) 
>               deriving (Show,Read,Eq,Ord)

When told to use deriving Show, Haskell create a `show` function for you.
We'll see soon how you could use your own `show` function.

> convertList [] = Nil
> convertList (x:xs) = x ::: convertList xs

> main = do
>       print (0 ::: 1 ::: Nil)
>       print (convertList [0,1])

This print:

~~~
0 ::: (1 ::: Nil)
0 ::: (1 ::: Nil)
~~~
