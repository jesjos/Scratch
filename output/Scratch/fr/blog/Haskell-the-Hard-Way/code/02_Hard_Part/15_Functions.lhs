To make things even better we should use higher level functions.
What are these beast?
Higher level functions are functions taking function as parameter.

Here are some examples:

<code class="haskell">
filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
foldl :: (a -> b -> a) -> a -> [b] -> a
</code>

Let's proceed by small steps.

<code class="haskell">
-- Version 5
evenSum l = mysum 0 (filter even l)
    where 
      mysum n [] = n
      mysum n (x:xs) = mysum xs (n+x) 
</code>

where

<code class="haskell">
filter even [1..10] ⇔  [2,4,6,8,10]
</code>

The function `filter` takes a function of type (`a -> Bool`) and a list of type `[a]`. It returns a list containing only elements for which the function returned `true`.

Our next step is to use another way to simulate loop. 
We will use the `foldl` to accumulate a value.
The function `foldl` capture a general coding pattern:

<pre>
myfunc list = foo <span class="blue">initialValue</span> <span class="green">list</span>
    foo accumulated []     = accumulated
    foo tmpValue    (x:xs) = foo (<span class="yellow">bar</span> tmpValue x) xs
</pre>

Which can be replaced by:

<pre>
myfunc list = foldl <span class="yellow">bar</span> <span class="blue">initialValue</span> <span class="green">list</span>
</pre>

If you really want to know how the magic works.
Here is the definition of `foldl`.

<code class="haskell">
foldl f z [] = z
foldl f z (x:xs) = foldl f (f z x) xs
</code>

<code class="haskell">
foldl f z [x1,...xn]
⇔  f (... (f (f z x1) x2) ...) xn
</code>

But as Haskell is lazy, it doesn't evaluate `(f z x)` and push this to the stack.
This is why we generally use `foldl'` instead of `foldl`;
`foldl'` is a _strict_ version of `foldl`.
If you don't understand what lazy and strict means,
don't worry, just follow the code as if `foldl` and `foldl'` where identical.

Now our new version of `evenSum` become:

<code class="haskell">
-- Version 6
-- foldl' isn't accessible by default
-- we need to import it from the module Data.List
import Data.List
evenSum l = foldl' mysum 0 (filter even l)
  where mysum acc value = acc + value
</code>

Version we can simplify by using directly a lambda notation.
This way we don't have to create the temporary name `mysum`.

> -- Version 7
> -- Generally it is considered a good practice
> -- to import only the necessary function(s)
> import Data.List (foldl')
> evenSum l = foldl' (\x y -> x+y) 0 (filter even l)

And of course, we remark 

<code class="haskell">
(\x y -> x+y) ⇔ (+)
</code>

<div style="display:none">

> main = print $ evenSum [1..10]

</div>
