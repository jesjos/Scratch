I changed from [whos.amung.us](http://whos.amung.us) to [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics).

Most of time I prefer not to use the same product as everybody and try some new. But this time I believe whosamung.us had too much ads on the page. I had to put their image on my website and they only give then number of user currently on the website, not the number of visits.

This is why I now use google analytics. The only problem, remains for pages with no javascript support.

Then for now: 
<div class="encadre">
Theorem:<br/>
<center>
Google Analytics <big><strong>&gt;</strong></big> Who's Amung Us
<center></div>
