# How to recompile your screensaver to be Snow Leopard(c) compatible

I upgraded to Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard(c), and my [YClock](/YBlog/YClock.html) screensaver didn't work on it. After searching on google, the problem seems to be just a recompilation away.
Unfortunately, event recompiling it in 64 bit it didn't work either.
After a bit more research (thanks to [ElectricSheep](http://community.electricsheep.org/node/236) ).

I discovered the good parameters for compilation.

For now I didn't compiled it to work also on Tiger and Leopard. I don't know XCode enought to know how to make the Garbage collector to be disabled on 32 bits version and enabled on 64 bits version.

It was a bit difficult to discover these informations. Hope this post helped someone.
