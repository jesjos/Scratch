the purpose of this part is to code the webserver part of your
application. Some really complete framework already exists for that.

## Let's code it ##

You choose a programming language (for readability I choosen
Ruby).

First you use a simple HTTP Server library (for simplicity
I choosen webrick)

Here an example of a very minimal HTTP Server. When it receives
a GET request at the port number 2000 at the directory '/' it returns:

<div><code class="html"><html>Content</html></code></div>

Here is the code:

<div>
<code class="ruby" file="minimalHttpServer.rb">
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require 'webrick'
include WEBrick
s = HTTPServer.new( :Port => 2000 )

class HelloServlet < HTTPServlet::AbstractServlet
    def do_GET(req, res)
        res.body = '<html>Content</html>'
        res['Content-Type'] = "text/html"
    end
end

s.mount("/", HelloServlet)
s.start </code>
</div>

You can try it yourself starting by downloading and starting the ruby program and clicking this [link (http://localhost:2000)](http://localhost:2000/) (You must start the server for this link to work).

I Believe what it does is mostly straightforward
