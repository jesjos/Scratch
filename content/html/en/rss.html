## My explanation


It is an easy way to aggregate all the update made on websites you like in a single place. You'll never have to surf many website to see if there is news on a website. 

### choose an aggregator


To begin, you must choose an RSS client called *aggregator*. There is many online clients: website which will present the news in a fancy way.


Personally I use [Netvibes](http://netvibes.com). I tried a bunch, and it is by far the best - In My Humble Opinion.


Of course [Google](http://google.com) has a client named [Google Reader](http://google.com/reader).
It is great for content you never want to forgot some article. It is not really useful when you have to handle flux generating many news per day. 

### Subscribe to some website news


Once you have chosen your aggregator, you only have to subscribe to websites you like. Do do this, you only have to click on the RSS icon in the top bar of your navigator. Or generally a nice icon is shown into the page you're reading.

### Get the news


Now, you'll only have to use your RSS client. And you'll see all news on all subscribed websites. There is no more need to surf many websites. All news which interest you are in the same place.
