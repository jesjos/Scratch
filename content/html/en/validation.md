One word to explain why there is some validation errors.

I wanted to use `box-shadows` and `border-radius`.

Then here I prefered pragmatism against dogmatism.

Using these properties broke my validation 
but work really well in the two most recent and main browsers
(Safari&nbsp;4 and Firefox&nbsp;3.5 at the time I'm writing these lines).
If you don't use these browser the page is 
correctly displayed but not with all the 'eyecandy' effects.


I believed in the benefits of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> 
validation, this is why there is alway the 
<abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> validation link on my pages. 
And all <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> validate except 
for properities beginning by `-moz` and `-webkit`.
