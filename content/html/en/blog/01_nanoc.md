What is nanoc?
=============================================

It is not exactly a 
<abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr>.
But a Framework to generate static web pages.

You have to program yourself webpages, the code
to generate the menu...

I added feature to make my website multilingual for example

You'll can find many informations on the
[official nanoc website](http://nanoc.stoneship.org).
