# Why This article and for whom? #

Many website explaining how MVC works.  But I can't found one who explain why.

I have difficulties to obey some principle don't know *why* I should use it. And something better than the:

> "Smarter people than you decided you have to do so"

This article is for people who like me want to understand the real motivation of using an MVC architecture and which advantage it gives you.

Let's start making a project from scratch pretending we don't know anything about the MVC architecture.  Then let see how we'll naturally derive to an MVC architecture.
