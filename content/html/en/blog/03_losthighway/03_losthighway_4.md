## What really happened?



There is many possibilities here. But we have many indices. Here is a supposition.


### #1 Hypothesis

!!fr!!

Je dirais que le protagoniste est un garagiste qui est tombé amoureux d'une actrice porno. Il l'a certainement vu la première fois accompagnant le fameux Dick Laurent. Voyant qu'il ne peut pas l'avoir pour lui, fou de jalousie il tue Dick Laurent dans un motel où celui-ci à couché avec Renée. 

On a la liberté de décider s'il a vraiment tué la femme ou pas.
Dans ma première vision du film, j'avais envie de dire qu'il ne la tue pas. Mais qu'une fois le meurtre commis, il va chez elle, sonne pour lui annoncer la mort de Dick Laurent. Il a alors juste le temps de s'enfuir, la police à ses trousses.

!!!!


The protagonist is a garagist fallen in love with a porno actress. He believe the producer is the bad guy who go again his will. Then he kills Dick Laurent.


### #2 Hypothesis



He was really married, he had killed his wife. The the remorse let him create an alternate self, which live in a kind of perfect world. But after the time pass, his obsession about the murder came again. And nobody could know if he had killed Andy or not.


## which one then?



The second hypothesis seems better. We can make much more interpretation with it. It explain in most part the strange phone call from Dick Laurent to Pete.
But the first hypothesis remain coherent. And, we should probably make an in depth explanantion using the first hypothesis. And I'm not sure it would be better.




One of the strength of this movie is to understand there is many other coherent hypothesis. It is an expression of the [Rashomon effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashomon_effect). Many different persons could describe in a coherent manner what they saw. But each description contradicts the others.

## Conclusion



There is much to tell about this movie. But I believe I put all essential keys here. It is a proof this movie is not a random one.




I believe it is essential to remember the "test of Rorschach effet" when watching this movie.



I'd like to know or opinion ; is my interpration wrong?
