# Movie's keys

<div class="encadre" style="text-align: center">
        <strong>
            All is in Fred's memory
        </strong>
</div>



In a first, it is clear for me, it is not a fantastic movie. If you follow this line, you'll face many problem explaining some scenes.




My hypothesis is the movie describe the Fred's representation of reality.
Each of his tries to escape reality will fail.




Fred had commited an horrible act, a murder, and try to *repair* his memory to accepts it. He'll then create alternative realities.


  - In a first time he kills his wife (Renee) because he believes she cheated at him.
  - In the second part, he's weaker and will be manipulated by the blond equivalent of Renee to kill Dick Laurent.
  - In a third part, he kills Dick Laurent

## Why this interpretation can be valid?



Because of the dialog at the begining of the movie. Cops ask Fred if he's own a video camera:


> - &ndash; Do you own a video camera?
> - &ndash; No, Fred hates them.
> - &ndash; I like to remember things my own way.
> - &ndash; What do you mean by that?
> - &ndash; How I remember them, not necessarily the way they happened.

!!fr!!
Ce que l'on peut traduire approximativement par :

> - &ndash; Avez-vous une caméra ?
> - &ndash; Non, Fred les détestes.
> - &ndash; J'aime me rappeler les choses à ma façon.
> - &ndash; Qu'entendez-vous par là ?
> - &ndash; Je me rapelle des choses pas nécessairement comme elles se sont passées.

!!!!



Then, what we see is not reality but the Fred's perception. Fred is the God of the reality we see. This is why some God/Devil interpretation of the movie works not so bad.
