## Who's at the origin of the video tapes?


Certainly it's the mysterious man (Fred himself) who makes them. 
Their reason should be:

  + Remember the reality to Fred. From Fred point-of-view, video tapes are the reality. He tries to forget reality. But, finally, the video tapes go to the end: the murder of his wife.
  + It may also be a reference to pornographic video tapes, made by Renee.
