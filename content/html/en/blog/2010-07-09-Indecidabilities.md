<%= tldr %> Four different _undecidabilities_:

- _Undecidability_ due to measure errors 
- _Hope_: small measure error implies small predictive errors.
- _Undecidability_ with big error from small measure error
- _Hope_: error remain controllable given a final mesure error
- _Undecidability_ with _discontinuities_
- _Hope_: Undecidability is due to error, but without any measure error, all is decidable
- _Undecidability_ without any measure error

Is the situation so bad we cannot truly believe anything?
A theorem in learning theory (in my thesis) prove that under some reasonable conditions, we could learn many true things. 
But at no moment we can be absolutely sure this is _the_ truth.
But as far as I can see, we cannot do better than that.
