This website was completely made from scratch.  Most is done using 
[Vim](http://www.vim.org) and I generate pages using 
[nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org).

<p>

Pictures were done with 
<a href="http://inkscape.org">Inkscape</a> and 
<a href="http://gimp.org">Gimp</a>. 
My website is versionned using the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Concurrent_Versions_System">
    <acronym title="Distributed Concurrent Versions System">DCVS</acronym>
</a> 
<a href="http://git-scm.com">Git</a>.

Blog comments are externalized to <del>[disqus](http://disqus.com)</del> [intense debate](http://intensedebate.com).
All I need is a static web server, no PHP, Java, ASP or CGI.
Main advantages of this method concerns the load 
and the security of the server.

<p>

If you didn't understood anything, just remember I used only 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSource">Opensource</a> 
and I mostly all done myself from scratch.

If you want all the gory details I suggest you to read
